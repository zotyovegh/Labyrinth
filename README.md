# Labyrinth Game

The Labyrinth game has been created for VIA University College' 6th Semester - Game Development
course.

The final product acquired the highest grade and greatly increased my interest in user-experience
based development.

The game is horror-themed and as the name suggests, the player has to find the way out (more precisely find
a treasure) from a Labyrinth, whilst facing potential enemies.

User actions and features:
* Place torches on the map, to be able to see and mark the already discovered sections of the map
* Having a limited life-timed hammer, to break walls and create shortcuts
* Having a gun with a certain amount of ammunition to kill enemies
* Levels (Survival game) and Custom game

The code is mostly created by me from 0, but certain clues to kickstart an idea during the development has been taken from the youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys
